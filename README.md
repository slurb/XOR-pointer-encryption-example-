# Pointer Encryption and Decryption in C

This C program demonstrates a basic example of pointer encryption and decryption using XOR operations. It takes a secret message and a random key to encrypt a pointer, and then decrypts it to reveal the original message.

## Prerequisites

Before running the program, make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system. You can use a C compiler like GCC to compile and run the code.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the source code.

3. Compile the code using your C compiler. For example, using GCC:

   ```shell
   gcc main.c -o pointer_encryption
   ```

4. Run the program:

   ```shell
   ./pointer_encryption
   ```

5. The program will encrypt and then decrypt the pointer, displaying the encrypted pointer and the original message.

**Note**: The compiled executable (`cipher.txt`) is meant for educational purposes and can be used for reverse engineering exercises with tools like IDA or Ghidra.
